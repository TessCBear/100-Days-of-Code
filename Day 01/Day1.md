# Day 1 of 100 Days of Code
## Band Name Generator

The first day of 100 Days of Code was relatively simple. The lesson focused on print statements, beginning with the classic "Hello World!" and progressing to more complicated statements.

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

I also learnt about string manipulations and inputs and eventually the output was a Band Name Generator. This takes input from the user and combines it into a name for a band. A fun little project to begin with!

```python
city = input('What city did you grow up in\n?')
```

I did know a lot of the concepts already, but it's always good to revise and there's always something new to learn. Ready for day 2!
