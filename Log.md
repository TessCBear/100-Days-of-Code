# Log of the projects I've made in the challenge

### Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%201)
#### Description of Program
A simple program that takes a city and a pet name as inputs and combines them into a proposed name for a band.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project for me, but still fun.

### Day 2: [Restaurant Tip Calculator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%202)
#### Description of Program
Another simple program that takes in a bill amount, tip percentage and number of people splitting a bill. It then uses this information to calculate how much each person should pay.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project. My only challenge was getting the program to print the entire cents value even when it was 0. 

### Day 3: [Treasure Island](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%203)
#### Description of Program
This program was more complicated. It used conditional statements to make a simple decision-based treasure hunt.

#### Thoughts
This was more difficult, but I really enjoyed the creative freedom and personalisation it gave me.

### Day 4 [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard Spock](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%204)
#### Description of Program
This is my personalisation of the original challenge. A game against the computer using randomisation.

#### Thoughts
The principle behind the game was relatively simple to implement. The hard part was making sure I had all of the options possible in my more complicated version!

### Day 5 [Password Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%205)
#### Description of Program
The program takes input of a number of letters, numbers and symbols to be used in a password. It then randomly chooses these characters and places them directly in that order (easier to crack) and shuffles the order (harder to crack), giving two possible passwords.

#### Thoughts
It was challenging to get all of the randomisation and shuffling right, but I did get it working in the end and learnt a lot along the way.

### Day 6 [Escaping the Maze](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%206)
#### Description of Program
The program helps a robot named Reeborg escape a maze. It uses some built-in functions and a strategy of how to navigate the maze. Reeborg starts at different random positions and could be facing in any direction. It is not the most efficient way of navigating the maze, but it does get him out eventually.

#### Thoughts
It was challenging to put the strategy given into code. It took a few tries and some debugging, but I got there in the end. I really enjoyed this fun and interactive way of learning a concept!
