# Log of the projects I've made in the challenge

### Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%201)
#### Description of Program
A simple program that takes a city and a pet name as inputs and combines them into a proposed name for a band.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project for me, but still fun.

### Day 2: [Restaurant Tip Calculator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day2)
#### Description of Program
Another simple program that takes in a bill amount, tip percentage and number of people splitting a bill. It then uses this information to calculate how much each person should pay.

### Thoughts
This was an easy project. My only challenge was getting the program to print the entire cents value even when it was 0.
