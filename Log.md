# Log of the projects I've made in the challenge

### Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%201)
#### Description of Program
A simple program that takes a city and a pet name as inputs and combines them into a proposed name for a band.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project for me, but still fun.

### Day 2: [Restaurant Tip Calculator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%202)
#### Description of Program
Another simple program that takes in a bill amount, tip percentage and number of people splitting a bill. It then uses this information to calculate how much each person should pay.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project. My only challenge was getting the program to print the entire cents value even when it was 0. 

### Day 3: [Treasure Island](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%203)
#### Description of Program
This program was more complicated. It used conditional statements to make a simple decision-based treasure hunt.

#### Thoughts
This was more difficult, but I really enjoyed the creative freedom and personalisation it gave me.

### Day 4: [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard Spock](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%204)
#### Description of Program
This is my personalisation of the original challenge. A game against the computer using randomisation.

#### Thoughts
The principle behind the game was relatively simple to implement. The hard part was making sure I had all of the options possible in my more complicated version!

### Day 5: [Password Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day%205)
#### Description of Program
The program takes input of a number of letters, numbers and symbols to be used in a password. It then randomly chooses these characters and places them directly in that order (easier to crack) and shuffles the order (harder to crack), giving two possible passwords.

#### Thoughts
It was challenging to get all of the randomisation and shuffling right, but I did get it working in the end and learnt a lot along the way.
