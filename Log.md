# Log of the projects I've made in the challenge

### Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2001)
#### Description of Program
A simple program that takes a city and a pet name as inputs and combines them into a proposed name for a band.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project for me, but still fun.

### Day 2: [Restaurant Tip Calculator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2002)
#### Description of Program
Another simple program that takes in a bill amount, tip percentage and number of people splitting a bill. It then uses this information to calculate how much each person should pay.

#### Thoughts
This was an easy project. My only challenge was getting the program to print the entire cents value even when it was 0. 

### Day 3: [Treasure Island](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2003)
#### Description of Program
This program was more complicated. It used conditional statements to make a simple decision-based treasure hunt.

#### Thoughts
This was more difficult, but I really enjoyed the creative freedom and personalisation it gave me.

### Day 4: [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard Spock](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2004)
#### Description of Program
This is my personalisation of the original challenge. A game against the computer using randomisation.

#### Thoughts
The principle behind the game was relatively simple to implement. The hard part was making sure I had all of the options possible in my more complicated version!

### Day 5: [Password Generator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2005)
#### Description of Program
The program takes input of a number of letters, numbers and symbols to be used in a password. It then randomly chooses these characters and places them directly in that order (easier to crack) and shuffles the order (harder to crack), giving two possible passwords.

#### Thoughts
It was challenging to get all of the randomisation and shuffling right, but I did get it working in the end and learnt a lot along the way.

### Day 6 [Escaping the Maze](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2006)
#### Description of Program
The program helps a robot named Reeborg escape a maze. It uses some built-in functions and a strategy of how to navigate the maze. Reeborg starts at different random positions and could be facing in any direction. It is not the most efficient way of navigating the maze, but it does get him out eventually.

#### Thoughts
It was challenging to put the strategy given into code. It took a few tries and some debugging, but I got there in the end. I really enjoyed this fun and interactive way of learning a concept!

### Day 7 [Hangman](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2007)
#### Description of Program
The classic game of "hangman". The computer randomly choses a word from a list. The user must guess the word one letter at a time before they run out of lives.

#### Thoughts
This was a really challenging project, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It really got me thinking and using all of the skills I've learnt.

### Day 8 [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2008)
#### Description of Program
A Caesar Cipher uses a predetermined shift to encrypt or decrypt a message. Letters are shifted a certain amount in the alphabet. For example a shift of 3 would mean "a" becomes "d", "b" becomes "e", and so on.

#### Thoughts
I found it difficult to implement the shifting, but I kept perservering and got there in the end.

### Day 9 [Secret Auction](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2009)
#### Description of Program
A secret aution allows bidders to enter their name and a bid amount without anyone seeing anyone else's bids. The program then calculates which bid was the highest.

#### Thoughts
This program was one of the easier ones for me. The idea of dictionaries made sense in my head, so it was easy to apply to the program.

### Day 10 [Calculator](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2010)
#### Description of Program
As the name suggests, this program is a mathematical calculator. It uses recursive functions to allow the user to indefinitely add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.

#### Thoughts
This program was also easy for me to do. It was fun to figure out how a calculator actually works and to make it interactive for the user.

### Day 11 [Blackjack](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2011)
#### Description of Program
The classic game "Blackjack". It is a simplified version since the deck is infinite and Ace only counts as 11.

#### Thoughts
I found this a good way to combine all of my skills so far. It took me a while to get it working efficiently, but wasn't too bad to do.

### Day 12 [Guess the Number](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2012)
#### Description of Program
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100 which the user must guess. Depending on the user's guess, the computer will guide as to whether its chosen number is "higher" or "lower" until the user reaches the correct number. For the easy level, the user has 10 lives and for the hard level the user has 5.

#### Thoughts
I have previously coded a similar program without the lives, so I didn't find it too challenging to adapt.

### Day 13 [Debugging](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2013)
#### Description
There was no real end program today. The lesson required us to fix bugs in various small pieces of code.

#### Thoughts
This was not a very challenging exercise, but it was good to try and find the bugs and satisfying when I got it to work properly.

### Day 14 [Higher Lower Game](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Beginner/Day%2014)
#### Description
The game presents the user with two celebrities. The user must decide which celebrity has the greater Instagram following. If correctly guessed, the second celebrity is then compared to a new one and the game continues. The user must try to get as many correct guesses in a row as they can.

#### Thoughts
I felt that my implementation was a lot simpler than the course instructors. It was not a particularly difficult challenge.

### Day 15 [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2015)
#### Description
This is a digital coffee machine. A user chooses a drink and inputs money. The program then decides if it has the correct resources and sufficient funds to carry out the order. 

#### Thoughts
This was probably the hardest challenge so far, so I'm proud of myself for completing it. It took a lot of thought and planning to do everything.

### Day 16 [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2016)
#### Description
Same as Day 15, but done using Object Oriented Programming.

#### Thoughts
I really struggled with implementing my new knowledge of OOP. It definitely makes the code a lot easier to see what's going on.

### Day 17 [Quiz](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2017)
#### Description
A simple quiz programme that presents the user with True/False questions to answer. The score is tallied at the end. This was done using OOP.

#### Thoughts
This was a fun project to create. I enjoyed the Step-By-Step instructions since it really helped to break down the project and make the new concept easier to apply. 

### Day 18 [Hirst-Style Painting](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2018)
#### Description
A program which uses *Turtle* graphics to create a Damien Hirst-style spot painting. 

#### Thoughts
I preferred the Spiragraph challenge today, but it was a fun project and I got to know more about *Turtle*.

### Day 19 [Etch-A-Sketch and Turtle Racing](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2019)
#### Description
The classic Etch-A-Sketch game and a Turtle Race using random step lengths on a number of turtles. The user must bet on which colour turtle will win.

#### Thoughts
I found these programs easy and thought it could have been made more challenging.

### Day 20 & 21 [Snake Game](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2020%20%26%2021)
#### Description
The classic Snake Game from old fashioned cellphones. The snake constantly moves, following the user's direction, and food randomly appears on the board. When the snake eats food, it grows larger. The user must try to get the snake as long as possible without colliding with the edge of the board or other parts of the snake's body.

#### Thoughts
This was the longest project we've made so far. I really enjoyed it, and I'm proud of myself for getting this far!

### Day 22 [Pong Game](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2022)
#### Description
The classic game of Pong. A ball is bounced between two paddles which can move up and down. If a player misses a ball, the opposing player gets a point and it resets.

#### Thoughts
I enjoyed making this game and using OOP to do it. The bouncing was difficult to think about, but easy once I got it.

### Day 23 [Turtle Crossing](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2023)

#### Description
A version of "Crossy Roads" where a turtle must navigate through traffic without being hit. The turtle can only move up. Once the turtle reaches the top of the screen, the level is complete and it resets with faster moving cars.

#### Thoughts
This was good practise for OOP and Turtle graphics. A few elements were hard to get perfect, but overall it wasn't too hard of a project.

### Day 24 [Mail Merge](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2024)

#### Description
A program which replaces a list of names into a placeholder in a letter and creates personalised versions of the same letter.

#### Thoughts
Overall not a difficult thing to implement, was interesting to see how it's done and think about this problem.

### Day 25 [US Guessing Game](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2025)

#### Description
A user must guess as many states as possible. When a correct guess is made, the state name appears over the location of the state.

#### Thoughts
Difficult to wrap my mind around some parts of the *Pandas* module, but otherwise not too bad to program.

### Day 26 [Nato Phonetic Alphabet](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2026)

#### Description
The program takes in a word and converts each letter into the Nato Phonetic Alphabet equivalent.

#### Thoughts
Took a while to get my brain to understand and implement, but amazing concept and makes the code so short!

### Day 27 [Miles to Kilometers](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2027)

#### Description
A program using *tkinter* which takes Miles and converts them into Kilometers

#### Thoughts
Not a difficult project, but got me used to working with *tkinter*.

### Day 28 [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2028)

#### Description
A program which automatically times the intervals of break and work for the Pomodoro productivity technique.

#### Thoughts
I learnt a lot more about *tkinter* and enjoyed the challenge of creating the timer mechanism.

### Day 29 & 30 [Password Manager](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2029%20%26%2030)

#### Description
A program which can add usernames and passwords for websites to a database and display said data when searched for.

#### Thoughts
I enjoyed this program, and learnt more about *tkinter* as well as exceptions and json files in the process.

### Day 31 [Flash Cards](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2031)

#### Description
A flash card which chooses randomly from a list and displays a Russian word. After 3 seconds the English translation is shown. The user can track whether they know the word or not and once known, the word will not be displayed again.

#### Thoughts
A good test of my skills so far with *tkinter* and *pandas*. 

### Day 32[Automated Birthday Messages](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Intermediate/Day%2032)

#### Description
This program checks a csv file for friends' birthdays. If today corresponds to a birthday, it will randomly choose from one of three letters and send an email to this person wishing them a happy birthday.

#### Thoughts
A really fun project that taught me how to send emails using code!
