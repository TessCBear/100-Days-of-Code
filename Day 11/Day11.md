# Day 11 of 100 Days of Code
## Blackjack

This was another "no lesson, just the project" day. It was nice to have a day with no new information to just consolidate all of the previous days. It was supposed to be one of the harder challenges so far, but I think I'm getting used to the coding mindset and I didn't find it too difficult. Making flow charts definitely helps.

I started by tackling it head on, and trying to make one entire program. Then I realised there was a lot of repetition and decided to rework it into functions that I could call as needed. The program is definitely a simplified version of Blackjack. The cards are infinite and the Ace just has a value of 11, rather than choosing whether it is 1 or 11, but it works and I got to apply all of my skills.
