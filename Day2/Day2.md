# Day 2 of 100 Days of Code
## Restaurant Tip Calculator

Today's focus was on different types of variables in Python and how to combine and manipulate them. The lesson started off by explaining the types of String, Integer, Float and Boolean. It then moved to basic mathematical operations, and played around with "BODMAS" in Python.

```python
#Example of how Python does BODMAS
#This would come out as 7

3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3
```
I also learnt how to convert from one variable type to another as well as about the floor and round functions which convert float variables into integers. Again, a lot of this was revision. But one new thing I learnt was about f-strings which allow for easy combination of different types of data in a print statement.

```python
score = 5
height = 1.8

print(f" Your score is {score} and your height is {height}")
```

The culmination of these skills was used to create a restaurant tip calculator. This takes in the bill total, desired tip amount and number of people splitting the bill and outputs the amount each person should pay.
