# 100 Days of Code
I've taken on the 100 Days of Code Challenge following [Dr Angela Yu's Python course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IHMAEcTeV9SR38D/) of the same name. 

## Date started: 26 January 2021

I've never been a huge programmer,  so I hope this will get me into the habit and I'm sure I will learn a lot in the process! Dr Angela's course starts right from the beginning and builds up slowly. It is interactive and fun and I can really recommend it for beginner programmers. 

## My Pledge
1. I will code for at least 1 hour for 100 days. 
2. I will push the code to GitHub everyday.
3. I will update the [log](https://github.com/TessCBear/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/Log.md) everyday to track my progress.
4. If, for some reason, I cannot code on a particular day, I will make it up on another day (ie. code twice).
