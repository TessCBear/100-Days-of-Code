# Day 10 of 100 Days of Code
# Calculator

Today's lesson focussed on functions with outputs (i.e. using the *return* keyword.) This is something I am familiar with using, but it was a good refresher. Something new that I learnt was what a *docstring* is and how to use it. This is very useful for remembering what a function does.

The final project was to make a calculator. We created functions of the four basic operators (+, -, *, /) and used these to allow the user to make calculations. We implemented a recursive function so that the calculator could keep calculating indefinitely. All in all it was a fun project!
