# Day 13 of 100 Days of Code
## Debugging

As stated in the title, today's lesson was about debugging code. It was one of the more boring lessons and didn't have an end project. A lot of the tips that Angela suggested were things I already do, but it was a good exercise to go through and figure out the bugs in various pieces of code. 

I'm looking forward to moving on to the next project.
