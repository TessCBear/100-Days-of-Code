# Day 14 of 100 Days of Code
## Higher Lower Game

Today's lesson was just a project, no new content was taught. The project was supposed to apply all of our knowledge learnt so far, but it was much simpler to code without functions in my opinion. 

The programme we built takes data from a list about celebrities' instagram followings. A user is presented with two celebrities and must decide which one has the higher instagram following. If correct, the second celebrity is now compared to a new celebrity and the game continues. The user must try to get as many correct as possible.

I didn't find this to be the most challenging of projects, but had fun putting it together. Ready to move onto the intermediate phase!
