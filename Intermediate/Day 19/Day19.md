# Day 19 of 100 Days of Code
## Etch-A-Sketch and Turtle Racing

This lesson felt a bit too easy for me. I kept thinking I was coding it wrong and that Dr Yu would show a much more elegant solution, but she didn't!

The aim of the day was to continue working with *Turtle* graphics to create some games. In particular, we learnt how to use the *on-key()* method to take input from the user and animate accordingly. 

The two projects we made for the day were an Etch-A-Sketch and a Turtle Racing game. I much preferred the Turtle Racing because I felt my Etch-A-SKetch code was very repetitive and clunky.
