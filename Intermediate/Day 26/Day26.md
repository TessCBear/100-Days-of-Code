# Day 26 of 100 Days of Code
## Nato Phonetic Alphabet

Today's lesson focussed on List Comprehension and Dictionary Comprehension. The basic format of this is:

```python
new_list = [new_item for item in old_list]
```

This was a really interesting concept and makes code a lot shorter in instances where this can be applied. It takes some getting used to, and I had to first code a regular *for* loop and then convert it into a list comprehension. 

We applied this concept to a Nato Phonetic Alphabet project. The program takes in a word and converts each letter into the Nato Phonetic Alphabet equivalent. I couldn't believe how short the code was, but it did take a lot of brain power to get right.
