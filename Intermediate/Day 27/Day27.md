# Day 27 of 100 Days of Code
## Miles to Kilometers Converter

Today we were introduced to the *tkinter* module. It was lots of fun to play around with the different types of widgets.

```python
button = tkinter.Button(text = "Click me", command = input_to_label)
button.pack()
```
The project for the day allowed us to combine the widgets to create a Miles to Kilometers converter complete with Labels, Entries and Buttons. Not a difficult task, but a good way to get to know the module.
