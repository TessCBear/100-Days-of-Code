# Day 22 of 100 Days of Code
## Pong Game

Today was a day where we didn't learn a specific skill, but created the classic game of Pong. The basic mechanics of the paddles was the easiest to implement, and the hardest to do was the bouncing of the ball. Once I figured it out mathematically, it wasn't that bad.

I'm starting to get used to and enjoy object oriented programming. It definitely makes the code a lot neater and easier for repetition. I really enjoyed today's project.
